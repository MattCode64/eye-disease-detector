# Eye Cancer Detector üîç

The "Eye Cancer Detector" is a groundbreaking technological innovation designed to early identify and diagnose eye cancer, primarily retinoblastoma and melanoma of the eye. Leveraging advanced machine learning and imaging techniques, the tool scans ocular images to detect anomalous patterns that may indicate malignant growths.

Early detection is vital in eye cancer treatment, as it allows for timely intervention, potentially preventing the spread of cancer and preserving vision. Traditional methods of diagnosis often require specialized medical expertise and may not always identify the disease at its earliest stages. This is where the Eye Cancer Detector comes to the fore, democratizing the detection process and making it more accessible to individuals around the globe.

Besides its primary diagnostic capabilities, the system also offers features such as tracking tumor progression over time and integration with electronic health records. As an embodiment of the convergence of technology and healthcare, the Eye Cancer Detector promises to be an invaluable tool in the global fight against ocular cancers.
